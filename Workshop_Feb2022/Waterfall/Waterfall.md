# Story: The pet rock club

I’m a member of a very exclusive club, where we meet on Saturday to play with chaotic rocks. Some people have brown/green, tiny rocks and some people have ones that can telekinesis. Regardless of how different they are, they all playing video games together and sing sparkle by Tatsuro Yamashita in rock language. It’s fun for us, their owners. We race them from the outside to the Shuswap Lake, take 10,000,000,000 pictures and sometimes paint them with cheese. All our grandmas are jealous. One time, best-friend showed up and taught the rocks how to speed reading. Now, we’re planning a treck to see whose pet rock wins.
